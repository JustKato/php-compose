# About
This repo includes a simple `php 8.0` `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`, along with a config file for apache, this is more of a template project for me to use whenever I need to write a PHP project but you are completely free to use it

I currently accept basically any kind of contribution, so feel free to correct my stupidity ðŸ˜‹
